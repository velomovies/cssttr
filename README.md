# Monster Magnet

CSS To the Rescue teached us to make a website for a specific user. We could only use the components provided by [`Vasilis van Gemert`](https://vasilis.nl/). I made an website about monster magnet with all components that everyone had to use. One little detail: **NO CSS CLASSES**

## Background

The website about Monster Magnet is for one user scenerio. A guy who wants to use the keyboard a lot. Next to that couldn't we use classes in the whole website. 

The website is build from a few components provided by the teachers. The challenge was to don't add any code and a minimum use of javascript or classes. The website I build has no javascript and classes. As we where teached this is not the best practice, but it gives us a look into the strength of css selectors.
